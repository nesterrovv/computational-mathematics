# Laboratory work 5. Numerical differentiation and the Cauchy problem. Milne method.

In laboratory work 5, you will be asked to implement one of the methods for solving the Cauchy problem - solving a differential 
equation for given initial conditions.

One step methods:
* Euler method
* Improved Euler method (not to be confused with the improved Euler method)
* Runge-Kutta method of the 4th order

Multi-step methods:
* Milne method
* Adams method (not to be confused with the Adams-Bashfort method)

In the lab, you are asked to prepare a number of differential equations that the user can solve by entering their 
own initial conditions. In addition, it is assumed that the user can choose how far the differential equation 
should be solved from the initial condition. When analyzing and demonstrating laboratory work, it is recommended 
to explore not only various differential 20 equation, but also different initial conditions for one differential equation - 
the graph of the solution will probably change in this case. The graph must show the initial condition and the resulting 
solution of the differential equation. It is also useful to display the analytical solution of the differential equation 
in order to be able to compare and analyze the accumulation or non-accumulation of the error. The approximation in both cases 
(for the analytical and for the obtained solution) must be performed according to the method from laboratory work 4 
(if in laboratory work 4 your option was an approximation, then double the number of graphsâ€“ before and after deleting points, 
as in laboratory work 4 - it is not necessary to draw, the method should be applied only once). conditions, as well as 
application scenarios based on the features of the methods.
