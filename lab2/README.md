# Lab work #2. Systems of nonlinear equations. Bisection and chord methods. Simple iteration method.

In Lab 2, you will need to implement three numerical methods. Two of them will solve non-linear equations and one more will solve a system of non-linear equations.

Due to the fact that you are offered to implement 2 methods for solving nonlinear equations, it makes sense to compare the result obtained between each other. F
or example, by solving the equation using the bisection method, we got 5.1, and by the chord method we got 4.9, then the difference between the two methods will be 0.2. 
Accordingly, the calculation of two methods for one equation should be carried out simultaneously, without specifying from the user which numerical 
method he would like to calculate the equation.

The student is invited to choose non-linear equations and systems of non-linear equations on their own. However, it is necessary to take into account 
the range of permissible values. For examples, you can choose both non-linear algebraic and non-algebraic non-linear equations.
